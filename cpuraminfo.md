## CPU & RAM info Module

I found out a great script written by Sebastian Batko for monitoring the CPU & RAM usage on any server. So I’ve adapted the code a little and created this module, that will show you the current usage.

Works on Windows AND POSIX systems
Don’t forgot to activate it in Module Admin after installation!

```

Install module:

```

Upgrade module:
