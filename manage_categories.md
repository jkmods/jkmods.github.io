## Manage Categories
![cpuraminfo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkmods/jkmods.github.io/master/manage_categories.png)

This module enables you to manage custom categories on your server.
You are allowed to manage only categories created by you, default server categories are blocked for good reasons.

So basically you can:

- see default server categories with counts of modules in each of them
- see custom server categories with counts of modules in each of them (if any)
- create custom category(ies)
- edit custom category(ies)
- delete custom category(ies)*

*Note: once some modules (at least one) are in the category marked for deletion, you will be asked for new category to which the modules will be moved.
I’ve also added a shortcut/button to “Module Admin” (opens in new window), so you can easily change module category in there.
