## Module Updates

Until solved by Sentora Team, Iâ€™ve created a module to check for any update of any module on server.

This module enables you to check and see if there are any available updates to your installed modules.
Currently you can check for new version of modules by clicking on button Check for updates manually, at the very bottom of the module. Changes are reflected also in Module Admin as the same table is used to store all info.

How to add my REPO:
```
zppy repo add jkmods.github.io
zppy update
```

Install module:
```
zppy install module_updates
```

Upgrade module:
```
zppy upgrade module_updates
```

Remove module:
```
zppy remove module_updates
```


Enjoy!
