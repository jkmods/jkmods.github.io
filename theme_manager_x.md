![cpuraminfo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkmods/jkmods.github.io/master/theme_manager_x.png)

With this module you can easily install, change or delete any theme inside the panel. There is also a count for users using the particular theme.
***This module was created only for zadmin!***

Main features:
- Change theme
- Delete theme from server (cannot be undone..)
 - Install new theme in easy way!

Same rules for the theme packages as for the module packages – zipped and renamed to zpt…( z panel theme – instead of zpp)
So anybody can get any theme for zpanel zipp it and upload it to server in easy way..
Then you just need to change it …
